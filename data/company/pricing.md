# Gaiytri Pricing and Plans

## Our Approach
At Gaiytri, we believe intelligent solutions should scale with your business — not restrict it.  
That’s why our **services follow a custom-quote model**, ensuring each client pays only for what they truly need.

---

## ⚙️ Service-Based Pricing
All automation, chatbot, and custom AI development projects are priced based on:
- **Scope and complexity** of the workflow or system  
- **Integration requirements** (e.g., APIs, databases, third-party tools)  
- **Ongoing support and maintenance** needs  
- **Timeline and deliverables**

Every project begins with a discovery consultation to assess goals, requirements, and expected outcomes. After that, we provide a **transparent proposal and quote** — no hidden fees or surprise costs.

---

## 🧩 Product Pricing
Our proprietary AI tools and platforms — such as **SkillMap AI** and other upcoming Gaiytri products — will be offered under **fixed-price models**.  
Each product will include clear tiers based on usage, features, and customization level.

Pricing details for these will be published upon official release.

---

## 🤝 Consultations and Pilots
We offer **initial consultations and pilot programs** for select clients to evaluate feasibility and impact before full-scale implementation.  
These pilots help businesses understand how Gaiytri’s AI systems can integrate seamlessly with existing operations.
